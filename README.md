# Redirect-After-Theme-Activation
If you have special instructions in your theme (eg. in your theme options page) that youâ€™d like the user to see when they first activate the theme, you can use the following function
# Add below code to your functions.php
    if (is_admin() && isset($_GET['activated']) && $pagenow == "themes.php")
      wp_redirect('themes.php?page=themeoptionstab');
# Note
Pay special attention to the wp_redirect() function. Make sure to replace the themes.php?page=themeoptions with the URL of your page.
